Review 2: I was looking for an affordable iPad Pro, and found this seller. I had a few questions and the seller gave a detailed response within a few hours. After placing the order, the iPad Pro was shipped the same day, and arrived an impressive 2 days later. It came well packaged and the condition was very good as they described. They even included a charging cord in the package, something that wasn’t expected. This is an honest, timely, and professional business and I would recommend! 5 stars!!

Review 7: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 arrived promptly as advertise. I was well packed to prevent damage. I bought a watch advertised as in "Excellent condition" and it arrived almost perfect. The band was new, but because of the excellent price it was not an Apple band. My fault, I had looked at the other watches and didn't notice this one was not Apple. Nevertheless, I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Definitely recommend this company. I will make them a favorite for future purchases.
